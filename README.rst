This little tool is intended to remind users to react to trac tickets.
It looks for tickets that have either been created or received comments from
people not belonging to a specific, configurable group of users.

It does NOT tell you, what tickets you are supposed to work on, it is just
meant to remind a team of developers that there are user comments that need
attention
